Get program to print flag, looking at src code we can see it's checking if "bico" is present on the heap.

In the src code we can see FLAGSIZE_MAX is set to 64, so we can try inputing a string greater than that to override bico's spot on the heap

this is possible because:

    scanf("%s", input) does not limit number of characters inputed.

    then when input is allocated via malloc(INPUT_DATA_SIZE) left over input gets spilled over to neighboring memory (safe_var)
