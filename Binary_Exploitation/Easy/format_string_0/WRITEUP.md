Sudgest Gr%114d_Cheese and Cla%sic_Che%s%steak

program forces you to exploit Format string with the choices
when printf() prints the input it tries to print with the formating.

when Gr%11ld_Cheese is passed:

    printf() tries to print an int from the stack thats 114 chars long,
    this plus _Cheese allows us to pass count. count > 2 * BUFSIZE (64),
    then serve_bob() is called.

when Cla%sic_Che%s%steak is passed:

    printf() tries to read mem from stack, 
    but %s doesn't give a location causing a seg fault.

    and the program is made to print the flag on a seg fault.

In theory if we could cause a seg fault any other way we would've gotten the flag.
